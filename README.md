# handprobdist

This is just a probability distribution calculator I made for hearts. I'm sure this data is already available, but I wanted to find it testably myself. Actual math could probably find this too, but this seemed faster.

The actual values can be found in the HeartsDistribution csv file.

As usual, after finishing this project(It took like 3 hours cause matplotlib hates me), I googled it and found someone else who did it much, much better. Check them out:
